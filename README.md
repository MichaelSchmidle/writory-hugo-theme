# Writory

Writory is a theme for the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The Writory theme offers color schemes and font sizes that are easy on the eyes. It allows to structure your books in chapters (the building blocks of books) and series (the collections of related books).

Checkout the Writory documentation and showcase on [writory.org](https://writory.org/).
